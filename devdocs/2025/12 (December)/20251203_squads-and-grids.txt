[to view current progress, run "battle map" scene on it's own.']
An hour of troubleshooting has passed.
After troubleshooting why rectangle checks weren't working properly, some glaring issues with
code implementation became apparent.  Squad spawning is still behaving erratically, mostly 
due to a poorly designed squad placement determination algorithm.  It may be time to go back
and establish a much more robust design if coordinates can't get handled properly.

NEXT THING TO CHECK

Find out if the erratic behavior is due to unit coordinates being relative to the "squad" object
they're spawned in, rather than relative to the battle map scene itself.   

OTHER REASONS TO DO IT
Would like to refactor the project in a Godot Game Template that makes transitioning between scenes
/ passing parameters between scenes easier.
