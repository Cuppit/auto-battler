A system for placing units needs to be realized.  

-player selects unit to place from unit purchase menu
-unit is "stuck" to mouse pointer
-player moves mouse pointer over possible areas to place
 unit

-The unit "snaps" to a grid of possible locations, 
 with a green layer under it (tile map layer?)

*** NEW SCENE REQUIRED: SQUAD ***

WHAT IS A SQUAD?

A collection of one or more of one type of unit, arranged such that they fit 
inside of a rectangle which corresponds to tiles on the battle map.  

*** SYSTEM NEEDED ***
	-A definition of the space on the battle map the player has access to 
	 placing units on; a way of fitting squads onto the map
	
BATTLE MAP DEFINITION
	A 70 x 39 arena filled with 16x16 pxl tiles
	
	EACH PLAYER GETS A 35x39 PLOT TO PLACE SQUADS ON
	
	Q: HOW TO DEFINE PLOT IN SCENE?
	A: Define rectangle coords for each side of the field in the BattleMap 
	   script.

WHAT'S NEEDED IS A ZONE MANAGER
...

a poorly described problem yielded unusable "zone" concept. 

--------------

WHAT GOT ACCOMPLISHED:
	-Squad concept defined
	-Will try scene inheritance to make new types of squads
	
	TODO:
		-place newly spawned squads in appropriate spots on map
		-design algorithm to identify open spots when adding 
		 squads
		-
