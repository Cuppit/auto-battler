TODO REMINDER FROM YESTERDAY:
	
		-place newly spawned squads in appropriate spots on map
		-design algorithm to identify open spots when adding 
		 squads
		
		
-- HOW TO ACCOMPLISH --
		
Suppose you have a 7x7 zone in which squads can be
placed: 

X X X X X X X 
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X 
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
	
1st squad has a 3x2 area:
-- 3x2 area 1 --

A A A
A A A


2nd squad has a 2x1 area:
-- 2x1 area 2 --
B B


3rd squad has a 4x3 area:
-- 4x3 area 3 --

C C C C
C C C C
C C C C




So how to place squads in the zone?  Time to write some 
pseudocode:

STEP 1 : CENTER RECTANGLE INSIDE OF ZONE

	0,0 of rectangle = top-left coordinates.  This needs to be positioned such that it is as centered
	as possible in the zone.

	-Put top-left corner into zone such that it is as centered as possible
	-ZONE DIMS: 7x7 
	-RECTANGLE DIMS: 3x2
	-CENTER POINT OF ZONE: 3,3
	
	var zone_center_h =  zonedims.x/2 [value: 3]
	var zone_center_v = zonedims.y/2 [value: 3]

	var rect_mid_h = MID-POINT OF HORIZONTAL DIM OF RECTANGLE: floor(rect_x/2)  [value: 1]
	var rect_mid_v = MID-POINT OF VERTICAL DIM OF RECTANGLE: floor(rect_y/2)  [value: 1]
	
	-WHERE TO (first attempt to) DRAW RECTANGLE?
	x = zone_center_h - rect_mid_h [value: 2]
	y = zone_center_v - rect_mid_v [value: 2]
	
SO!  THIS is the FIRST spot the game will attempt to place the squad!  
	
STEP 1: PLACE SQUAD no. A
	
pretty straightforward, the squad ends up as such:
X X X X X X X 
X X X X X X X
X X A A A X X 
X X A A A X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X

And so, it has ended up (approximately) in the center.

STEP 2:  PLACE SQUAD no. B

Trying to do the same thing results in:
X X X X X X X 
X X X X X X X
X X B B A X X 
X X A A A X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X

Obviously it can't fit there, so something I'm going to call a "spiral search"
needs to happen.  It's called "spiral search" because the squad searches for
a valid spot in a "spiral" pattern, starting from the original coordinate 
it tried to land at, and gradually checking other coordinates by turning 
outwards in a spiral direction.

STEP 1: check first coord to the right (3,2):
X X X X X X X 
X X X X X X X
X X A B B X X 
X X A A A X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
error: still overlaps with A.  

STEP 2: check 1 up from current position (3,1):
X X X X X X X 
X X X B B X X
X X A A A X X 
X X A A A X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
X X X X X X X
SUCCESS: B is successfully placed.  

Finally, when repeating this process, after 7 iterations of the search,
squad C lands in this position:
	
	STEP 2: check 1 up from current position (3,1):
X X X X X X X 
X X X B B X X
X X A A A X X 
X X A A A X X
X C C C C X X
X C C C C X X
X C C C C X X

SLIGHT PROBELM WITH THIS METHOD:  If it runs against a corner
