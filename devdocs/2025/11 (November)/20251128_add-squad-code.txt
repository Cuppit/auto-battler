PROBLEM: Function for adding a new squad tries to use unit scene instances as key values
(Godot doesn't support this).   

SOLUTION: Rethink how to track squad placement on the board.  
	NEW IMPLEMENTATION: the squad scene now has it's coordinates as a property
	(...why didn't I just implement it that way in the first place?)
