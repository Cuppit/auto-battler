YESTERDAY'S PROBLEM SOLVED: The function I was modifying was never even called/used, causing a
button which was supposed to instantiate a scene to not actually instantiate anything.

TODAY'S PROBLEM: The "squads" are implemented as a generic container that holds an arrangement
of units.  This container gets instantiated and placed on the map.  

THIS CAUSES A PROBLEM WITH POSITION AND COORDINATES.  The actual units themselves have positions
**relative to the 'squad' container they were instantiated in**, and not coordinates relative to the
map they're in play on.

PROPOSED SOLUTION: Write a function that makes the squad container "give" the units to the map, 
adjusting position coordinates appropriately, then removing itself for the round.

NOW THIS REQUIRES EXPLICIT, ROBUST TRACKING OF THE CURRENT BOARD STATE FOR EACH ROUND, AS WELL
AS TRACKING WHICH ROUND IT IS.


---NOTE FOR FUTURE WORK ON THIS PROJECT---
TODO: FINISH FIXING 'ADD SQUAD' FUNCTIONALITY
	-Algorithm is janky/broken, and doesn't search correctly for a spot to place a unit.  Fix that.
	

TODO: DESIGN MATCH SCENE
	-Contains:
		-Parameters (players, starting armies)
		-Match tracking functionality (current round, player stats/resources, etc) 
		-Battle Map
