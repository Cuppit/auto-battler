*** WHAT IS THIS? ***

This is an attempt at creating a top-down 2D auto-battler in the spirit
of auto-chess games like Mechabellum.

INITAL SETUP: a field split evenly into two sides, each round each player
picks some units to add to their army and where they are on the field.  Then
the battle starts.  Last man standing wins the round, and the loser loses
points relative to the strength of the remaining army of their opponent.

TODO

-design unique units
-develop:
	-scene structure
	-art assets
	-code
	
HOW TARGET SELECTION WORKS
There's no getting around iterating over every enemy every game cycle, it seems.

conceive game process:
	-initial round is initiated
	-enemy army is spawned
	-player chooses pieces to drop
	-battle commences
	-results are tallied up
	-next round starts
	-game ends when one player's points are reduced to zero
	
	WHAT KIND OF UNITS ARE THERE?
	
		-the pewpewer: simple blob that shoots pellets at a rate of one per second, at a range of,
		 I dunno, 200 pixels?
		
		EVERY GAME CYCLE:
			unit attempts to move towards closest enemy
			if enemy is in range, fire
